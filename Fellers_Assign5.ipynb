              "xxbos i have watched this episode more often than any other xxup xxunk episode , it is that enjoyable . xxmaj and it is quite scary , but all in good , xxunk fun . a woman kills her 2nd husband but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a xxunk xxmaj santa xxmaj claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl a visit at that very moment . xxmaj mary xxmaj xxunk , who i seem to remember from xxup snl or some other xxup tv comedy skit show , is the evil wife , and xxmaj larry xxmaj drake plays the lunatic in the xxunk xxmaj santa outfit . i had forgotten xxmaj santa was played by xxmaj drake over the years . xxmaj his xxmaj santa is an unstoppable force and quite frightening at times . xxmaj you can probably guess how xxmaj santa finally gets into the house . xxmaj the episode is played for laughs , but it also can be pretty intense at times .,xxbos xxmaj as many reviewers here have noted , the film version differs quite a bit from the stage version of the story . i have never seen the stage version of the story , and therefore i have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers . xxmaj perhaps xxmaj richard xxmaj attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film , but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer xxmaj michael xxmaj douglas ' show . xxmaj the film does right by not selecting any famous actors or performers to wind up in the final try - out group . xxmaj this way our attention is focused on the dancers ' movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of try - outs . xxmaj douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part . xxmaj apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one , and the xxunk cliché - ridden story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was added . i have to say in all xxunk this was the weakest part of the film . xxmaj the repeated xxunk xxmaj xxunk made during try - outs appear to mirror the almost desperate xxunk one often has to make when engaging in the artistic xxunk in the absence of talent and / or luck . xxmaj however , this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past , and it 's curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its xxunk up once again . xxmaj the revelations of the dancers themselves began promisingly enough with the \" i can do that \" number , but then it xxunk a little at various points while the dancers were telling their stories . xxmaj frankly , their stories xxunk little from real life folks who never get a chance like this . * * * of 4 stars .,xxbos xxmaj at first , this movie seems so bad that i almost fell in a xxunk the first time i saw it . xxmaj it was like a bad dream . a cosmic bore . xxmaj but i gave it a second chance , then another and another , etc ... i finally got addicted to this film , due to it 's dreamlike slow pace , wonderful natural sets , bathed in a mellow autumn light and especially the musical score , which is made of some 70 's xxunk rock and absolute exquisite folk songs by actor / singer / songwriter xxmaj derek xxmaj xxunk xxunk should notice the song about hazel wood , silver xxunk and lady vanishing in the air ... xxunk in the middle and near the end of the film . xxmaj there are some xxunk scenes in the beginning , xxunk allow us to appreciate the natural charms of xxmaj elizabeth xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj if that movie had been made by some \" repertoire \" directors like xxmaj bergman , xxmaj lars xxmaj von xxmaj xxunk or xxmaj jean - xxmaj luc xxmaj xxunk , critics would have rolled on the floor , xxunk about that movie as if it were a cosmic masterpiece . i personally think this film is one million times superior to any of xxmaj fellini 's cinematic sh # xxunk not for the pretentious .,xxbos xxmaj was this based on a comic - book ? a video - game ? a drawing by a 3 year - old ? \n",

              "  xxmaj it 's xxmaj showtime ... was a great success .,xxbos xxmaj this is one of the best movies i have ever seen . xxmaj it is about true love and friendship . xxmaj about turning your life around and doing something good for someone else . xxmaj thomas xxmaj bo xxmaj xxunk may play the same role he has done in so many other movies , but recently we have seen him in other roles which he does great too . xxmaj but so what if he plays the same role that he has done in other movies  he 's perfect for that role . xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk does a great job too . xxmaj these two criminal \" low - xxunk \" are the best friends ever . xxmaj they share everything and they do everything for each other no matter what the costs are . xxmaj when they find out that xxmaj peter 's daughter is being abused they put everything on hold ( things you ca n't put on hold unless you have to make even more criminal acts ) and takes her to a better place . xxmaj they do the best they can  these two men are not xxunk but they have their heart in the right place . xxmaj all i can say is that xxmaj peter and xxmaj xxunk are my xxmaj biggest xxmaj heroes too \n",
              ",xxbos xxmaj this movie took me by surprise . xxmaj the opening credit sequence features nicely done animation . xxmaj after that , we 're xxunk into a semi - cheesy production , xxunk its low budget . xxmaj the characters , typical xxmaj american teens , are introduced slowly , with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this . xxmaj by the time the xxunk hits the fan , we know each one of the characters , and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities . xxmaj it 's a slow xxunk set - up , kind of like the ride up a xxunk of a really tall roller coaster . xxmaj thankfully , once the action kicks in , it 's full blown old school xxup horror ! xxmaj steve xxmaj johnson 's make - up effects are awesome . xxmaj equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films . xxmaj and the scares are xxunk . xxmaj kevin xxmaj xxunk delivers his best movie ever , with heart - stopping surprises and creepy suspenseful set - ups . xxmaj the tongue - in - cheek , sometimes cheesy , humor marks this film as pure 80s horror , as opposed to the xxunk tone of earlier genre fare like \" xxmaj night of the xxmaj living xxmaj dead \" or \" xxmaj hills xxmaj have xxmaj eyes . \" xxmaj but for true horror fans , this one is worth checking out . xxmaj play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of \" xxmaj house on the xxmaj haunted xxmaj hill . \" xxmaj the set - up and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually xxunk ?,xxbos i am xxunk for the sequels . i needed something to keep me from going insane with tension , anxiety ( what if it is n't as good ? ! ) , and constant lack of information . i needed something to calm me a little , something to pass the time , other than , of course , xxmaj the xxmaj matrix . xxmaj this was just the thing . \n",

              "  i found it xxunk ( like the part about xxmaj keanu 's neck ... ) and some of it was funny . i xxunk xxmaj carrie - xxmaj anne s xxrep 4 o much when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys . i found only one problem with it . xxmaj given that 95 % of the people there were as a matter of fact male , they just kinda let their mouths run wild , and there was language in it . xxmaj it 's not near as bad as xxmaj the xxmaj shawshank xxmaj redemption 's xxunk runs , but that one scene were xxmaj keanu is describing a bad day , plug your ears if you are little . xxunk \n",
